#  Agglomerative Clustering Analysis on gene expression dataset
This a solution notebook to an assignment question given in a Data Mining graduate course. Each code block is accompanied by relevant analysis wherever required. </br>
Dataset link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq </br>
Broadly, the following steps have been performed in this solution notebook:<ul>
<li> Minimal preprocessing on the dataset </li>
<li> Explained wide usage of Agglomerative clustering over Divisive Clustering </li>
<li> Visualization of given class labels using TSNE</li>
<li>  Ran agglomerative clustering using the following linkages {single, complete, group average, minimum variance}. 

<ul> <li> Compared the clustering performance both visually and
empirically on the dataset.   </li>
<li>Reported the best results on various cluster validity indices.</li>
</ul>
</li> 
These above assumptions and the flow of work is according to the questions asked in assignment.
